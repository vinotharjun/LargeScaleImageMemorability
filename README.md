# LargeScaleImageMemorability
Progress in estimating visual memorability has been limited by the small scale and lack of variety of benchmark data. Here, we introduce a novel experimental procedure to objectively measure human memory, allowing us to build VMEMNet the better model to capture the memorability of the photographs  which is trained on the  the largest annotated image memorability dataset to date (containing 60,000 images from diverse sources). Using VMemNet, we show that fine-tuned deep features outperform all other features by a large margin, reaching a least error (MSE) 0.011 (all model implementaion notebooks can be found in experiments directory )
